Prerequisite Skills in Microsoft® Excel
---------------------------------------

We will be using Microsoft Excel throughout the semester.

There are a number of excellent tools for solving optimization programs as part of a subject such as 15.053. We have selected Excel because of its broad applicability and power of expression, including a variety of graphical tools for visualizing data. For optimization, the most important "add-in" is Excel Solver, which can be used to solve a wide range of optimization problems.

The expressiveness of Excel comes at the cost of having a long learning curve. We do not (and should not) expect a mastery of Excel, or even anything close to mastery. However, students who have little or no experience with Excel should acquaint themselves with the fundamentals in the following areas:

*   Getting started with Excel
*   Managing workbooks
*   Managing worksheets, cells, and cell data
*   Summarizing data using formulas and functions
*   Formatting worksheet elements
*   Working with charts (graphs)
*   Printing and exporting

For its enrolled students and staff, MIT provides free use of the software tutorial service [Lynda.com](http://www.lynda.com/). Many excellent tutorials for Excel can be found there.
